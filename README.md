# Ball_Drop_Sim
This project simulates the motion of a ball considering gravity, drag force, and restitution. Written in C++, it outputs results to a file and includes a search feature for specific data points. Useful for learning physics and C++ programming. Future improvements: advanced data visualization, detailed physical models, and enhanced UI.
